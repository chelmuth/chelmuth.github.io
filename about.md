My name is Christian Helmuth. I've been developing the [Genode OS
Framework](https://genode.org/) professionally since 2008 in a small and
tight-knit team at [Genode Labs](https://www.genode-labs.com/) in Dresden,
Germany. Working every day on an open-source project that will change the world
(bit by bit) is the job of my dreams. Each day of hacking brings a funny
incident with computer hardware, tough debugging nuts to crack, or simply just
another oddity of programming languages and tools.

So, I started this blog to present some of those episodes and also to report
about the progress of my personal leisure-time projects with Genode.

[freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=%23genode&uio=d4)
and have a chat.
