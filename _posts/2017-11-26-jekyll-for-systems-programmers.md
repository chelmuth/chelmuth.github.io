This is the obligatory first post and there's not yet much to tell about my
Genode project. Today I just recollected what I learned about GitHub pages,
Jekyll, the Cayman Blog theme, and web wizardry two weeks ago. Back then, I
decided to finally start this project - this evening I knocked together the
framework and mounted the canvas. So here it is, but it was a stony path with
Jekyll. (No, I'll not joke about Mr. Hyde!)

Fortunately, I also got an idea about providing a comment feature for the blog
just with the GitHub issue tracker. So, I'm not frustrated to much ;-)
