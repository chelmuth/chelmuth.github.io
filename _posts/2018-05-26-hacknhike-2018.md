This day's hike took us south to the
[Czech border](https://osm.org/go/0Mg7A5xL--). We visited the rock formations
Dackel and Gro√üe Orgel before we walked an arc to the Nonnenfelsen, where we
had relaxing lunch. Returning at about 4 also gave us some time to return to
our projects before dinner.

I invested some hours to get network booting running with Cobalt and,
therefore, reworked the run script for loading scenarios to targets by the iPXE
bootloader. iPXE is preinstalled on the apu2 and able to load boot modules via
HTTP, which reduces boot times significantly compared to TFTP. The script can
be found on my
[branch](https://github.com/chelmuth/genode/blob/cobalt/tool/run/load/cobalt).

For a concurrent test of all NICs in Cobalt, I adapted the `lwip` scenario to
start on NIC-driver component per NIC device. Also, I had to configure our x86
platform driver explicitly to hand out the different PCI device resources to
the different drivers by the following policy entries.

```
<policy label_prefix="lan1_drv"> <pci bus="1" device="0" function="0"/> </policy>
<policy label_prefix="lan2_drv"> <pci bus="2" device="0" function="0"/> </policy>
<policy label_prefix="lan3_drv"> <pci bus="3" device="0" function="0"/> </policy>
```

The patch also includes explicit routes for the *Nic* service for three
instances of the mini HTTP server to the actual drivers. It can be found on my
[branch](https://github.com/chelmuth/genode/commits/cobalt).
